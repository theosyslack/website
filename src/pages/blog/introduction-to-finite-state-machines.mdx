# Introduction to Finite State Machines

Suppose that you wanted to write a program that mimics a stoplight. For this example, a stoplight has a few important properties to consider.

- Be able to display three colors -- `Red`, `Yellow`, and `Green`
- Must only show one of these color at a time
- Must be sequential.

That last point is the most tricky. It's easy enough to accomplish the first two just by updating a variable `lightColor`. But it's too easy to accidentally set `lightColor` to the wrong color -- or even worse, something confusing like `Orange` or `Chartruse`. So, how can we create a function that ensures the light color is changed exactly how we'd expect it?

This is where a Finite State Machine comes in handy.

Finite State Machines are a coding pattern that you can use to simplify managing your application. There a few reasons why you might use Finite State Machines (FSMs).
